        <p>
          "Solar cars shall be equipped with a horn that can be heard at a sound power level between 75 and 102 dBA
          at a distance of 15 m in front of the solar car. The horn shall be permanently mounted, operated from the
          steering wheel, and shall be able to operate for up to 5 minutes continuously at the required volume."
        </p>
        <h3> ESP32 Dev Board </h3>
        <p>
          The first major sub circuit is the ESP32 Dev Board. It is implemented with an ESP32 Wroom 1 and necessary peripherals
          including boot and reset buttons, and a USB to UART IC. The design process came mainly from reading the ESP and UART IC
          datasheets and picking correct passives around them. The layout was tricky due to needing differential routing for the UART
          and USB differential lines. Effort was also taken to deal with large current draw from the horn by having large polygon power 
          planes around the amplifier. 2nd Layer was also used as a ground plane for similar reasons. There was also a large effort by me
          to make the boards layout modular and readable through verbose silkscreen and documentation of each sub circuit on confluence.
        </p>
        <h3> Power </h3>
        <p>
          The board has the challenge of using 12V CAN BUS power for most LV operations, but requiring an 18V aux pack for the higher current
          draw amplifier. This is achieved through two diode OR circuits. There is one for LV between the 12V CAN line (that comes from a differential
          five pin molex connector to the car) and the 5V USB power. This diode OR goes into a 3.3V buck converter, that was chosen to allow
          flexibility with 12V and 24V CAN lines, as well as interfacing with the 5V USB. The other OR circuit is between the 18V and 12V circuit,
          with a priority circuit using FETs that chooses the 18V power. This allows for a nominal 18V power on the amplifier, with a redundant
          12V in case the aux pack dies. The biggest design problems were the general high power draw of the horn, that required a lot of thermal
          considerations and IC choice.
        </p>
        <h3> Sound </h3>
        <p>
          The sound architecture goes: ESP digital IO pin -> I2C based DAC -> High gain amplifier -> Speaker. Between the digital pins and the DAC
          there is open drain architecture for data and clock. The output of the DAC has heavy decoupling capacitors to smooth output, as well as a
          LP filter to attenuate high frequencies. The amp only takes positive voltage, so the output sine wave must be biased to 1.65 volts before
          going into the amp. After the amp, we chose a large capacitor in series with the speaker to cut the DC bias. The hardest design decisions
          were finding a DAC, amplifier, and speaker setup that interfaced with each other and the given power constraints. This was solved with
          hand calculations for gain as well as breadboarding and simulations with SPICE.
        </p>
        <h3> Bring Up + Verification </h3>
        <p>
          The board in the image is the 2nd iteration of the board. During the first bring up we noticed two things while bench testing. One, we greatly
          underestimated the power draw of the amplifier relative to the trace width and heat sinks we had. Second, we found a data sheet misread
          of the UART IC leading to us needing to jump D+ and D- with microwire. Both we fixed in the second iteration. The bring up process for the 
          second draft was done mainly with: DC power supplies and multimeters to verify power circuitry; waveform generators to verify the amplifier;
          oscilloscopes to verify the digital and analog signals coming in and out of the DAC; and CAN snooping combined with Serial monitoring to debug 
          firmware. We however did have a shorted trace caused from a polygon and trace being too big, leading us to cut it with a knife. In the end, 
          the horn worked with a few microwire jumps and traces cut.
        </p>
        <h3> Firmware </h3>
        <p>
          The firmware for the most part is simple, relying heavily on datasheet reading and use of the I2C interface. The main interesting thing was
          to figure out how to create a digital sound signal to output. We effectively took layered sine waves representing the signal we wanted to output
          and summed the amplitude at sampled points. We then put it into an array and iterated through the array to output the value. Otherwise, we had
          to interface into the CAN interface of the rest of the car. This includes reading data and looking for a signal from steering to power on the horn,
          and sending a heartbeat on CAN to the rest of the car to signal the horn boards microcontroller is still operational.

        <h3> Op-Amp Circuit </h3>
        <p>
          The pedal circuit is centered around a bandpass filter going through an op-amp in order to shape and amplify the guitar signal.
          The op amp is in the non-inverting configuration with a varaible resistor to determine the feedback, therefore controlling the
          gain. There is a HP filter before and after the op amp to attenutate DC signals and to boost treble frequencies. There is a LP
          filter in parallel with the potentiometer to create a desired gain within the bandwidth. The result is a treble boosting circuit that
          attenuates signals outside of the desired treble range.
        </p>
        <h3> Simulation & Testing </h3>
        <p>
          Each filter of the pedal was simulated in LTspice to validate frequency response, stability, and expected bode plot behavior.
          Frequency analysis confirmed the bandpass characteristics and the correct cutoff frequencies. I observed the time domain plots 
          as well to validate the phase didn't flip to -180 degrees. Both time and frequency domain analysis allowed me to verify that the
          passives I chose were the correct values in order to achieve the correct bandwidth and gain. I further verified on a breadboard
          using an oscilloscope and waveform generators to simulate different frequency signals, in order to find a frequency response. I
          finalized the project by plugging in my guitar input into the circuit input, and the output into my amplifier to verify the
          correct output sound.
